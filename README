WebDyne is a mod_perl/FastCGI based HTML dynamic content engine. It allows
for realtime generation of HTML documents using Perl code and/or modules. It
can potentially make small projects more readable and large projects more
manageable.

Once WebDyne is installed any file with a .psp extension is treated as a
WebDyne source file. It is parsed for WebDyne specific tags (such as <perl>
and <block>) which are interpreted and executed on the server as
appropriate. The resulting output is then sent to the browser. Once pages
are parsed once they are stored in a partially compiled format, speeding up
subsequent processing.

The aim of WebDyne is to make coding web pages with Perl components a
faster, easier and more maintainable experience.
