**** INTRODUCTION ****

WebDyne is a  HTML dynamic content engine. It allows for realtime generation
of HTML documents using Perl code and/or Perl modules.

WebDyne will work with Apache, Lighttpd, IIS. It uses mod_perl with Apache
and FastCGI with other web servers to attain a high level of performance.

An installer is included in the base WebDyne module for Apache, other
installers are available by downloading the appropriate module (e.g. 
WebDyne::Install::Lighttpd) from CPAN.

Once WebDyne is installed any file with a .psp extension is treated as a
WebDyne source file.  It is parsed for WebDyne specific tags (such as <perl>
and <block>) which are interpreted and executed on the server as
appropriate.  The resulting output is then sent to the browser.

Pages parsed once are are optionally stored in a partially compiled format, speeding up
subsequent processing.

The aim of WebDyne is to make coding web pages with Perl components a
faster, easier and more enjoyable experience.
