WebDyne is a  HTML dynamic content engine. It allows for realtime generation
of HTML documents using Perl code and/or Perl modules.

WebDyne will work with Apache, Lighttpd, IIS. It uses mod_perl with Apache
and FastCGI with other web servers to allow for decent speed.

An installer is included in the base WebDyne module for Apache, other
installers are available by downloading the appropriate module (e.g. 
WebDyne::Install::Lighttpd) from CPAN.

Once WebDyne is installed any file with a .psp extension is treated as a
WebDyne source file.  It is parsed for WebDyne specific tags (such as <perl>
and <block>) which are interpreted and executed on the server as
appropriate.  The resulting output is then sent to the browser.

Pages parsed once are are stored in a partially compiled format, speeding up
subsequent processing.

The aim of WebDyne is to make coding web pages with Perl components a
faster, easier and more maintainable experience.
