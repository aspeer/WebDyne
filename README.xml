    <para>WebDyne is a dynamic content generation engine for Apache/mod_perl
    and PSGI web servers (such as Plack and Starman). HTML documents with
    embedded Perl code are processed to produce dynamic HTML output. </para>

    <para>An installer is included in the base WebDyne module for Apache, or a
    PSGI variant is included for use with Plack. Once WebDyne is installed any
    file with a <filename>.psp</filename> extension is treated as a WebDyne
    source file. It is parsed for WebDyne tags (such as
    <tag>&lt;perl&gt;</tag> and <tag>&lt;block&gt;</tag>) which are
    interpreted and executed on the server as appropriate to generate a
    compliant HTML document. The resulting output is then sent to the browser.
    </para>

    <para>Once parsed paged are are optionally stored in a partially compiled
    format, speeding up subsequent processing. The aim of WebDyne is to make
    coding web pages with Perl components a faster, easier and more enjoyable
    experience.</para>

    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>Install the WebDyne module from CPAN using cpanminus or cpan, and
    install Plack for the PSGI version.</para>

    <programlisting language="bash">#  Use cpan if you don't have cpanm
#
$ cpanm WebDyne
Building and testing Webdyne-2.04 ... OK

$ cpanm Plack
Building and testing Webdyne-1.0051 ... OK</programlisting>

    <para>Run the PSGI variant in test mode and connect to the server to check
    that it is working</para>

    <programlisting language="bash">$ webdyne.psgi --test
HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/</programlisting>

    <para>Create an app.psp file in the appropriate web server home directory.
    Don't be put off by the shortcut &lt;start_html&gt; tag, you can still use
    traditional tags if you like.</para>

    <programlisting language="html"># Create file called app.psp with this content.
#
&lt;start_html&gt;
The local server time is: &lt;perl&gt;localtime()&lt;/perl&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Run the PSGI variant against that directory</para>

    <programlisting language="bash"># 
$ webdyne.psgi /location/of/app.psp
HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/
</programlisting>
